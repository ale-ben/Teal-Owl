# 1. Teal Owl Project
The Teal Owl project is part of my master thesis in computer science at University of Bologna.
The goal of the project is to prototype a system that allows for tracking of textual media provenance, providing a way to verify the authenticity of the content and the authorship of the text.

## 1.1. Teal Owl components
- [Teal Owl Reader - Chrome Extension (this repository)](https://github.com/ale-ben/Teal-Owl_Reader)
- [Teal Owl Publisher - Google Workspace Add On](https://github.com/ale-ben/Teal-Owl_Publisher)
- [Teal Owl Contract - Smart Contract on Ethereum blockchain](https://github.com/ale-ben/Teal-Owl_Contract)
- [Teal Owl Watermarking - Core Watermarking logic used by Publisher and Reader](https://github.com/ale-ben/Teal-Owl_Watermarking)

## 1.2. Teal Owl Reader - Chrome Extension
Teal Owl Reader is the end user interface for the project.
This component is responsible for reading the information stored in the text, validating it, and displaying it to the user.
